# Native land map data write-up

This data comes from [Native Land Digital](https://native-land.ca/), an Indigenous-led non-profit based in Canada that “strives to create and foster conversations about the history of colonialism, Indigenous ways of knowing, and settler-Indigenous relations, through educational resources.”

Native Land Digital has collected the possible historical boundaries of Indigenous territories and languages. Many of them overlap.

*Please note this disclaimer from Native Land Digital: "This map does not represent or intend to represent official or legal boundaries of any Indigenous nations. To learn about definitive boundaries, contact the nations in question. Also, this map is not perfect - it is a work in progress with tons of contributions from the community. Please send us fixes if you find errors."*

Contained in this repo: 
- An excel sheet with 3 tabs: 
  1. **Every territory within our DMA**
  2. **Every language within our DMA**
    -Both the territories and languages tabs include links to the Native Land Digital description 
  3. **Number of territories and languages in each DMA**
- A geojson (mapping) file for both the language and territory boundaries for each DMA. 
- A [searchable map](https://abcotvdata.github.io/native-land-map/map/index.html) using Native Land Digital’s api. Search your zip code to find out which Indigenous territories have once overlapped with your zip code.
